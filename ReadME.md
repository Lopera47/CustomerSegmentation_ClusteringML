General information:
1. This is a personal project done by Luis Lopera.
2. The main aim is to improve my machine learnig skills aplying a K-means and Hierarchical clustering models.
3. In this project I used a dataset from kaggle based on credit card custermers.
(link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/credit-card-customer-data)
4. All the necessary requirements are on requirements.txt

- Research question:
Different stores have increased their interest on knowing the behavior of their customers.
This behavior could be describe by Machine Learning models such as K means and Hierarchical clustering.
For that reason this project has been developed to understand if:

How can clustering Machine Learning models describe the behavior of credit card customers?.
